# AWS Data Analytic Platform for The City of Vancouver

## Project Description

The City of Vancouver requires a migration to AWS to implement a robust data analytic platform (DAP). As the hired data team, we aim to:

1. Design and implement the data analytic platform.
2. Prepare a comprehensive report documenting the work.

Step 1: DAP Design and Implementation
 Table 1: Requirements for the Data Analytic Platform
| Requirement # | Requirement Description |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Req #1        | Design and implement a data analytic platform to support descriptive analysis. |
| Req #2        | Add a feature to the platform to support exploratory analysis. 

| Req #3        | Calculate the monthly cost of running this platform in AWS. |
Step 2: Report Structure

The report will include the following sectionsFirst Page
1. **Introduction**  
   Explanation of the role and importance of the DAP for the City of Vancouver and an outline of the steps taken.

2. **DAP Design and Implementation**  
   Each individual will contribute to the descriptive and exploratory analysis sections using a consistent four-step structure:
   - **Step 1: Data Ingestion**
   - **Step 2: Data Profiling**
   - **Step 3: Data Cleaning**
   - **Step 4: Data Pipeline Design**

3. **DAP Estimated Cost**  
   Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs for the platform.

4. **Assignment Rubrics**  
   Breakdown of evaluation criteria for the work.
